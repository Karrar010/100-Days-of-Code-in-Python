# TYPE HINT (A feature useful with dynamic typing)
we declare the data types of variables, functions return and classes and specify so that later on in code in will be helpful

e.g:
def func(name : str) -> str:
    return "Hello" + name

-> name : str  # is the data type declaration for variables 
and if alter in code we write:
    name = 123  # this will show error
    name = ""  # only string is possible

-> def func() -> str  # this means that the function will return a value of data type string

    return "Hello" + name  # as this is a string
