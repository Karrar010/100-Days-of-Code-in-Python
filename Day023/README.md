# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

A fun arcade-style game built using Python's `turtle` module. The player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy road filled with moving cars. The goal is to reach the top of the screen without getting hit!

This project is part of Angela Yu's **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp** on Udemy.
